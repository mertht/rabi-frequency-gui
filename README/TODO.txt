RABI GUI TO DO:
- force pulseblaster to shut down after measurement AND set output pins to zero (not guaranteed by pb_stop())... put in Hardware.m?
- update physical layout of GUI
- test clock speed in program (almost positive it is 100 MHz)
- MATLAB gets fatal error upon pb_stop() in command line... why?
- add options for exporting graphs, data, etc.
- upload to GitHub

EXTRA STUFF
- show integration region by plotting box on image
- add image to gui instead of creating new figures
