RABI GUI TO DO:
- MATLAB gets fatal error upon pb_stop() in command line... why?
- add options for exporting graphs, data, etc.
- figure out why Matlab fatal error occurs when stopping pulse blaster after closing
- transfer PB programming to Harware and account for laser response offset in pulsed experiments

EXTRA STUFF
- add image to gui instead of creating new figures
